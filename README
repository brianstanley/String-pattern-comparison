This script built in PHP can compare an string with a pattern and return the similarities results.

For example.
You pass the next array for the comparisson:
$compare=array("drink?","eat","food","cars");
And the pattern is:
$pattern = "Cars";
the script will return the next output.
Word: drink? | Pattern: cars

Final result: 62.5% possibilities

Word: eat | Pattern: cars

Final result: 50% possibilities

Word: food | Pattern: cars

Final result: 50% possibilities

Word: cars | Pattern: cars

Final result: 100% possibilities
